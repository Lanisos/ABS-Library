# ABS-Library
 Library to support the creation of ABMs for simulation in Unity

 The according documentation will be found in an option inside Unity, under **Help -> ABS Library Manual**.

## Credits:

 * The parts of the code that use a template to generate a new script have been partially inspired by the one that can be found at [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27802185/unity-4-6-editor-create-a-script-with-predefined-data), with adaptations pertinent to the context of the library.

 * The simulation time code has been partially inspired by the one that can be found at [this link](https://discussions.unity.com/t/accelerate-decelerate-custom-game-clock/47535/3), with adaptations pertinent to the context of the library.

 * Everything else is completely from scratch.
